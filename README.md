# Yuxiang's Intern at Millennium, Summer 2020, as Quantitative Developer
This project is mainly to record my internship at Millennium, i.e. the papers I read, the tools I learned, the toy examples I experimented on, the ideas I proposed for trading futures & the questions, etc. I won't include any intranet resources here, neither will I fork any internship codes. 

For the following two reasons, I built this project. First, recording my daily progress helps me better reflect and retrospect. Even though I've learned a library, e.g. Dask, a priori, I still need all the documentation and examples for help when I really work on Dask, since I can barely remember all the interfaces by heart. For this reason, I will also include all the links I looked for help. Similarly, recording the main ideas & methods of every paper I read is essential for building my own trading strategy, especially because an internship strategy is almost a "combination" and "implementation". Personally, in the first two years I start working as a quantitative researcher, I will read those classic works of my predecessors: Standing on the shoulders of giants is a good way for research. Secondly, this will help me better demonstrate my work to my mentor, Alex.

The materials I used are basically written in English. However, out of some reasons, I inevitably included a few Chinese and Frech resources.
## Pre-internship learnings
Following Alex's and Jing's instructions, I armed myself familiar with the following topics:
### Dask
[The Dask Documentation](https://docs.dask.org/en/latest/)
[the Dask.Distributed Documentation](https://distributed.dask.org/en/latest/) and [the examples](https://github.com/dask/dask-tutorial) are substantial materials for learning Dask. I've learned the APIs for Array, Bag, Dataframe, Delayed. But I haven't learned Distributed in details. It seems an advanced API for scheduling. I read until Build Understanding/Efficiency.

### Rolling Continuous Futures
### Leveraging time series momentum to trade futures
### Reinforcement Learning and Deep Reinforcement Learning
[The Gomoko project](https://github.com/junxiaosong/AlphaZero_Gomoku) basically implements the AlphaZero to Gomoko Games.
### DRL for trading
### LSTM model 
### SQL
### Airflow
### Python OOP Review
### Miscellanea
- What is the "cross-section"? [This link](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/40852/what-is-cross-section-in-cross-section-of-stock-return/40857) explained the concept in a understandable way but that's not enough. If the study of cross-section aims to answer the question why stock A earns higher/lower returns than stock B, then does the cross-section simply rank the returns in a universe?

- On June 11, Dow plunges nearly 7% as stocks post worst session since March. I really can't figure out why, 
although many plunges in history are equally difficult to explain. The resurgent coronavirus cases due to past protests are not sufficient to explain since the negative sentiment that appeared many days ago should have been slowly digested day by day. 
I would rather attribute this to the behavior of certain funds. But could a few number of funds be that powerful?
