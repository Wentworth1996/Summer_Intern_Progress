# Yuxiang's Intern at Millennium, Summer 2020, as Quantitative Developer
This project is mainly to record my internship at Millennium, i.e. the papers I read, the tools I learned, the toy examples I experimented on, the ideas I proposed for trading futures & the questions, etc. I won't include any intranet resources here, neither will I fork any internship codes. 

For the following two reasons, I built this project. First, recording my daily progress helps me better reflect and retrospect. Even though I've learned a library, e.g. Dask, a priori, I still need all the documentation and examples for help when I really work on Dask, since I can barely remember all the interfaces by heart. For this reason, I will also include all the links I looked for help. Similarly, recording the main ideas & methods of every paper I read is essential for building my own trading strategy, since an internship strategy is almost a "combination" and "implementation". Personally, in the first two years I start working as a quantitative researcher, I will read those classic works of my predecessors: Standing on the shoulders of giants is a good way for research. Secondly, this will help me better demonstrate my work to my mentor, Alex.
